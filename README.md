# Wiki-App

The WikiApp is a simple full-stack web application that lets users create, read, update, and delete wiki-style articles. It is designed as a self-contained knowledge management system — all data is stored in a MongoDB database, and no external APIs (like Wikipedia) are used.


# Features:
✔️ View all saved wiki-style articles.
  
✔️ Add new articles with a title and content.

✔️ Search for articles by title.

✔️ Update existing articles (title/content).

✔️ Delete specific articles.

✔️ Collapsible article view for clean browsing.

✔️ Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

# Technical Overview (Behind the Scenes):

HTML & CSS: Structures and styles the layout and article content.

JavaScript: Handles interactions like search and navigation.

EJS Templating: Dynamically renders article content from the backend.

Node.js & Express: Manages routing and serves static/dynamic pages.

MongoDB: Stores the article data (titles, content, etc.).

Mongoose: Used for schema-based interaction with the MongoDB database.

Render: Used for deploying and hosting the application.
